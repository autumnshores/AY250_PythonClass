Homework 9

Homework9.ipynb contains code written for the Monte Carlo simulation in 3 different parallelization methods:

1) Serial processing
2) Multiprocessing
3) Ipython Parallel

After each simulation is run consecutively, a graph is plotted comparing execution time (in seconds) as well as simulation rate (defined as number of darts per second) as a function of the number of darts.

Before running the Parallel section of the notebook, please start 4 engines in the Clusters tab.

My computer specs: MacBook Pro with 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7

note: multiprocessing and parallel do not seem to be running the way they should be, not sure what is wrong with my code :(
